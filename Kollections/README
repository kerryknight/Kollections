README - Kollections

__________________________________________________________________
DEVELOPER NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------------
- Creating a kollection creates an entry in the Activity table as "created" with just a kollection pointer added; toUser and fromUser are both filled in as the current user
- Photo objects have no relation to anything other than the user pointer which points to the photo's creator
- Subject objects only have pointers to the kollection which they are a part of
- To link Photo objects with Subject objects, when a Photo object is created/uploaded, and Activity of "submitted" is also created; this Activity object contains a pointer to the kollection, subject and photo objects it pertains to
- If a kollection or subject object is deleted, the "submitted" activities are modified and the kollection and subject pointers are cleared; the photo object pointers remain and the photo objects are untouched; this will allow users to resubmit the same photo elsewhere without redundant uploads
